# ISAC-SIMO Lite Dashboard
This repository contains the [ISAC-SIMO](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ISAC-SIMO) Lite Dashboard (not tailored towards the specific [Build Change](https://github.com/Call-for-Code/ISAC-SIMO-Django-Backend) use case). This provides a convenient developer test environment to work with pipeline models.
